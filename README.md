## Introduction

A full-stack MERN application utilizing MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, the four technologies that make up the stack. This was to be accomplished while having a polished front-end/UI, a folder structure meeting the MVC paradigm, and incorporating good quality coding standards. Additional requirements included: 1) Having both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data. 2) Deploying to Heroku with data. 3) Utilizing at least 2 new libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed in class. 4) Authenticating users in some way.

The app also had to be responsive.

I started off without react to use SQL. But using MongoDB in this case might be better choice for the cause.
