## Introduction

 A full-stack MERN application utilizing MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, the four technologies that make up the stack.  This was to be accomplished while having a polished front-end/UI, a folder structure meeting the MVC paradigm, and incorporating good quality coding standards.  Additional requirements included:
    1)  Having both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
    2)  Deploying to Heroku with data.
    3)  Utilizing at least 2 new libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed in class. 
    4)  Authenticating users in some way.

The app also had to be responsive.
