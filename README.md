## Introduction

A full-stack MERN application utilizing MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS, the four technologies that make up the stack.

The app also had to be responsive.

## Description

A Retro Clothing Website
![Database Schemas](./client/src/img/siteimg/p3.png)

## User Story

Our user story is as follows:
```
--AS A: Person that loves retro clothing, but can not find any anywhere.
--I WANT: A site retro website
--SO THAT: I can buy or get custom retro items the way I have always dreamed of.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I want a custom retro outfit made
WHEN I click customs
THEN I am presented with options
WHEN prompted to chose what type
THEN I fill out the form and wait to be contacted.
```

One aspect of this project that makes it stand out is when you come to this site, you get a 1 on 1 interview on the items you want custom made from old to new. Thats why it is named Retro Luxeâ„¢.

## Features

## Review

## Usage

The URL for this application will soon be [http://www.retroluxe.com].

But for now, the Heroku link for this application is [https://retroluxesite.herokuapp.com/].

I started off without react to use SQL. But using MongoDB in this case might be a better choice for the cause.
